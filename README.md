## Abstract

Heart rate (HR) monitoring is essential for evaluating physiological health and
identifying cardiovascular problems early. Most HR monitors need skin contact, but remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) provides a non-invasive option by analyzing subtle skin color
changes through video. This method, also called video plethysmography (VPG), is beneficial for
people who cannot use contact-based monitors, such as those with sensitive skin or in remote
monitoring situations. VPG uses consumer-grade cameras to measure heart and breathing rates
without wearable devices. This enables its use in various domains, such as sports optimization,
emotional communication in human-machine interaction, and driver monitoring. However,
estimating HR from video accurately is challenging due to subject movement and lighting
variations. This study presents a novel approach to HR measurement using quaternion algebra,
an improvement over complex numbers, to exploit the relationship between RGB camera color
components effectively. Our framework aims to offer continuous HR monitoring in diverse
settings, such as telemedicine, fitness, and psychological assessments.
